        <h1 class="review__header header--light">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects
          I learned were current, if not more
          so,
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
        <p class="review__text text--light">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the
          bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
          startup.

        <h1 class="review__header header--light">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the
          bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them
          and
          learning from their experiences was easy.</h1>
        <p class="review__text text--light">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress
          which I find really refreshing. The
          program
          gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a
          capable
          junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you
          need
          from
          an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

        <h1 class="review__header header--dark">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!
        </h1>
        <p class="review__text text--dark">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line
          of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
          by a
          former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
          curriculum and
          staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
          The
          agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way
          that no
          tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
          developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
          multiple
          offers.
          100% recommend! ”</p>
